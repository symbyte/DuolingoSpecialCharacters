#Bindings
 holding alt while pressing the corresponding vowel will give the accute accented version of that value. Additional binds are as follows:
 alt-z : ¡
 alt-x : ¿
 alt-n : ñ
 alt-w : ü
 
 You may be thinking "Why alt w for the u with the diéresis???" I just think of it as double dot "u". So w (double <dot> u) made sense to me.
